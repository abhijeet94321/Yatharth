/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the Yatharth 2025 application.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user-specific data is nested under /users/{userId}.
 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 *  - /users/{userId}/meditationSessions/{sessionId}: Stores individual meditation sessions for a user.
 *  - /users/{userId}/dailyMeditationSummaries/{summaryId}: Stores daily meditation summaries for a user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - Only authenticated users can access their own data.
 *  - Listing the /users collection is denied.
 *  - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase, focusing on ownership and relational integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The 'userId' is present in both the path and the document data for meditation sessions and daily meditation summaries to allow for path-based authorization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - No structural segregation is used, as all data is private and user-specific.
